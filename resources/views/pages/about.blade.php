            <h2>Hey There! I am</h2>
            <p class="name">Basile Leroy from Belgium</p>
            <p>I am a backend developer but but have been doing full stack projects too. Primarily I focus on <span class="focus-normal">PHP</span>/<span class="focus-normal">Laravel</span>. My career started as a self thaught developer but I ended joining a training to increase my skills and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Next, I was able to work on a few projects. But soon, I got invited to be a <span class="focus-normal">coach</span>/<span class="focus-normal">trainer</span> at the same organisation where I was trained. Since then I have been training jobseekers in Belgium to find a job as a webdeveloper.</p>
